# SolarAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea is to create a program that can scan large portions of land and make recommendations about the most suitable spots for a solar farm.


## Background

The way we produce and use energy in everyday life is one of the key factors in solving current environmental challenges. The idea for this project was inspired by observations I made on this issue, while traveling. 
There are many countries in the world that receive a lot of energy from the sun throught the year, but still rely on conventional energy sources for heating, transport, cooking etc. There could be a variety of reasons for this, like: lack of financial resources, expert knowledge or technical equipment, to name a few.

## How is it used?

The tool is meant to be used by communities/regions/countries that are looking to shift a portion of their enery supply to solar energy and are looking for the most suitable and efficient way to do so. For example, local authorities can use it to identify good locations for solar farms, and prepare projects and plan budgets accordingly.
It is important that the solution takes into account the energy needs of the community, the climate and georgraphical characteristics of the region as well as the already existing infrastructure.

## Data sources and AI methods

First a training set will need to be created. On a high-resolution satelite image of a large enough area, a team of experts will label the areas which are suitable for a solar farm, using a variety of criteria. 
The supervised learning method can be combined with reinforcment learning in order to provide better recommendations. taylored to the needs of the specific community.
The AI methods used will be Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

## Challenges

The collections and processing of training data will take quite a bit of effort and resources. 
In terms of the implementation on site, there will probably be many legal challenges that will have to be solved concerning land ownership.

## What next?

The project is quite ambitions, and in order for it to grow, collaboration among AI developers, engineering experts and the civil population is of the outmost importance.
