# SolarAI

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The idea is to create a program that can scan large portions of land and make recommendations about the most suitable spots for a solar farm.


## Background

The way we produce and use energy in everyday life is one of the key factors in solving current environmental challenges. The idea for this project was inspired by observations I made on this issue, while traveling. 
There are many countries in the world that receive a lot of energy from the sun throught the year, but still rely on conventional energy sources for heating, transport, cooking etc. There could be a variety of reasons for this, like: lack of financial resources, expert knowledge or technical equipment, to name a few.

## How is it used?

The tool is meant to be used by communities/regions/countries that are looking to shift a portion of their enery supply to solar energy and are looking for the most suitable and efficient way to do so. For example, local authorities can use it to identify good locations for solar farms, and prepare projects and plan budgets accordingly.
It is important that the solution takes into account the energy needs of the community, the climate and georgraphical characteristics of the region as well as the already existing infrastructure. 


Images will make your README look nice!
Once you upload an image to your repository, you can link link to it like this (replace the URL with file path, if you've uploaded an image to Github.)

If you need to resize images, you have to use an HTML tag, like this:
<img src="https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2017/09/28/18/45/solar-2796471_960_720.jpg" width="300">

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```


## Data sources and AI methods
Where does your data come from? Do you collect it yourself or do you use data collected by someone else?
If you need to use links, here's an example:
[Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs)

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Header      | Title       |
| Paragraph   | Text        |

## Challenges

What does your project _not_ solve? Which limitations and ethical considerations should be taken into account when deploying a solution like this?

## What next?

How could your project grow and become something even more? What kind of skills, what kind of assistance would you  need to move on?
